1. Write a program to find the sum of digits of a positive integer number repetitively in
such a way so that this displays the single digit sum. Input number = 67895, Sum of
digits = 6+7+8+9+5 = 35, 3+5 = 8, So, output = 8
2. Find all Prime Numbers between 1 to N
3. Write a program to display the Fibonacci series up to a range. Fibonacci numbers are 0, 1, 1,
2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ....... i.e., the next number will be the sum of previous two numbers.
4. Special number: A positive integer, if the sum and product of its digits are equal. Let's
take the number 1124 and check. First, we will split it into digits (1, 1, 2, 4). After that
find the sum and product of all the digits. Sum=1+1+2+4=8. Product=1*1*2*4=8
